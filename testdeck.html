Steps for Go Live in January
1. Update all Automated email templates with appropriate messages for each email interval.
(Don't use {{{Sender.Signature}}} in the email templates. The logo will not render.)
2. Update Church Visit Cadence with the email templates and intervals that make sense for your processes.
Ensure the "Add to email thread" checkbox is selected or deselected based which option looks better after testing
3. Note if you'd like the Investments Team and Loans Team to be able to see each other's Cadences, update the Cadence Folder Sharing (Same goes for the Email Template Folder Sharing)
4. Remove Sales Engagement Basic User Permissions and Assign Sales Engagement User Permission to Users (having both on one user can cause issues)
5. Users can set Cadence Settings working days and hours in their Personal Information settings (from view profile Avatar on the upper right of the page)

Web to Lead
Functionality could be explored for https://churchinvestorsfund.org/ “Invest Now” action.
Web to Lead allows you to select fields to be filled, generates an html form with a form action endpoint that will create the lead record in salesforce.
Because the webform is already fully built out on churchInvestorsfund.org, your website team might be able to leverage the action instead of using Salesforce’s form.

            <div class="raw-text">
In Setup > Web to Lead and “Create Web-to-Lead” form
For Web to Lead Proof of Concept Testing
● Correct action attribute: Your form's action attribute must be set to the Salesforce endpoint: https://test.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.WebToLead?encoding=UTF-8.
If you are using a production environment, the URL will be https://webto.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.WebToLead?encoding=UTF-8.
● Essential Hidden Fields: The Salesforce form generator includes specific hidden input fields that are essential for the submission to work correctly.
You must copy these from the generated code into your existing form:
● oid: This is your Salesforce Organization ID, which tells Salesforce where to create the lead.
● retURL: This specifies the URL the user will be redirected to after the form is successfully submitted.
● Matching Field Names: The name attributes of your existing form's input fields (e.g., for First Name, Last Name, Email) must precisely match the name attributes in the Salesforce-generated HTML (e.g., first_name, last_name, email).
● Required Fields: Ensure all fields that are marked as "required" in your Salesforce Lead object settings or page layouts are included in your website form and have data submitted.
Submissions that violate validation rules will fail to create a lead record.
