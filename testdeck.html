        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>**Update Lead Status Investments Cadence**: This flow updates the Lead Status field as the Lead continues through the Investments Cadence. [cite: 175] After the first contact, the Lead is set to **Contacted**. [cite_start]After the first automated email at the two-week mark, the Lead is set to **Nurturing** and stays in this status.

        <h3>Future Cadence Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>**Phone Number Only Cadence**: A process could be created to automatically put any Leads without emails but with phone numbers (collected after a church visit) into a special Phone Number Only Cadence. [cite: 187, 188]</li>
            [cite_start]<li>**Screen Flow to Capture Lead Details at Church Visits**: Create a dedicated app to be used during Church Visits, requiring an Ipad or tablet. [cite: 183, 185] [cite_start]The Screen flow captures Lead Name, Email, Phone Number and creates a Lead Record. [cite: 184]</li>

            [cite_start]<li>Existing reports on the Sales Engagement Dashboard have been updated for Current users. [cite: 181]</li>

        <h2>Enhancement Ideas</h2>

        [cite_start]<h3>Teams Integration [cite: 189]</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The Teams Integration is a **$0 SKU** that you could explore in the future. [cite: 190]</p>

        [cite_start]<h3>Opportunity [cite: 191]</h3>
        <p>Future recommendation to review differences between Investments vs Loan. [cite_start]Perhaps create Opportunity record types, page layouts, stages and probabilities that correspond with the type of Opportunity. [cite: 191]</p>

        [cite_start]<h3>Web to Lead [cite: 192]</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>Functionality could be explored for <code>https://churchinvestorsfund.org/</code> “Invest Now” action. [cite: 192] [cite_start]Web to Lead allows you to select fields, generates an HTML form with a form action endpoint that will create the lead record in salesforce. [cite: 193]</p>
        [cite_start]<p>Since the webform is already fully built out on <code>churchInvestorsfund.org</code>, your website team might be able to leverage the action instead of using Salesforce’s form. [cite: 194] [cite_start]To create the form, go to **Setup > Web to Lead** and “Create Web-to-Lead” form. [cite: 195]</p>
        [cite_start]<h4>Web to Lead Proof of Concept Testing [cite: 196]</h4>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>**Correct <code>action</code> attribute**: Your form's <code>action</code> attribute must be set to the Salesforce endpoint: <code>https://test.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.WebToLead?encoding=UTF-8</code> (or <code>https://webto.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.WebToLead?encoding=UTF-8</code> for production). [cite: 196, 197]</li>
            [cite_start]<li>**Essential Hidden Fields**: You must copy the following hidden input fields from the generated code into your existing form: [cite: 198, 199]
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li><code>oid</code>: Your Salesforce Organization ID. [cite: 199]</li>
                    [cite_start]<li><code>retURL</code>: The URL the user is redirected to after successful submission. [cite: 200]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            [cite_start]<li>**Matching Field Names**: The <code>name</code> attributes of your existing form's input fields (e.g., for First Name, Last Name, Email) must precisely match the <code>name</code> attributes in the Salesforce-generated HTML (e.g., <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>email</code>). [cite: 201]</li>
            [cite_start]<li>**Required Fields**: Ensure all fields marked as "required" in your Salesforce Lead object settings or page layouts are included in your website form and have data submitted, as submissions violating validation rules will fail. [cite: 202, 203]</li>
        </ul>

        [cite_start]<h3>Flows for Mass Emails [cite: 204]</h3>
        <p>If you need to send a generic reminder email to all or a portion of your partners, you can create a Flow to do the work for you. [cite_start]Choose either a **screen flow** or a **scheduled flow** depending on your user’s preference. [cite: 204, 205]</p>
